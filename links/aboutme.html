  <p>Hi, my name is Henry. My full name is Henry Vinh Tran, with my middle name coming from my Vietnamese Heritage. Vinh means glory and in conjunction with my brother's middle name means victory; a way of my parents' advice to stick together and trust family. Tran is a Chinese surname--my father is Chinese--and the story goes that a government servant of the Tran emperor was bestowed the honor of the surname to his future descendants. </p>
